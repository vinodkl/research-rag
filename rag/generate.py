"""Step 5 - Generation: the model answers from the retrieved chunks, with receipts.

The whole trick of RAG happens here: the retrieved chunks go into the prompt,
and the model is told to answer ONLY from them. Three rules make that stick:
  1. ground: answer only from the passages,
  2. allow refusal: "the papers do not cover this" is a correct answer,
  3. cite: every claim needs a chunk id and a verbatim quote.

The response is forced into a JSON schema, so citations come back as data we can
verify (see guards.check_citations) - not as prose we would have to trust.
