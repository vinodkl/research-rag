"""Step 4 - Vector store: index the vectors, search by similarity (Week 3: "Vector Databases").

A vector store does three things: hold the vectors, find the nearest ones to a
query fast, and persist to disk. FAISS is that as a library - no server to run.

We use a flat (brute force) index: at a thousand chunks, exact search is
instant. Approximate indexes like HNSW exist for the million-scale case, where
scanning every vector per query stops being an option; the interface stays the
same, which is why swapping the index type later is cheap.
